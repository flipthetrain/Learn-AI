This file contains a list of prompts designed to help you (or an AI agent) recreate, update, or maintain the `readme.md` file for the Learn-AI project. To use this file:

1. Open this file in your editor or provide it as input to your AI assistant.
2. For each prompt, copy and paste it into your AI agent or instruct the agent to execute the prompt as a task.
3. Review the output or changes made by the agent to ensure accuracy and completeness.
4. Use these prompts as a checklist for periodic maintenance, updates, or full regeneration of the README.

You can also instruct the AI agent to run all prompts in this file sequentially to fully recreate or refresh the documentation.

# Prompts for README.md Creation and Maintenance

Below is a list of prompts that can be used to recreate, update, or maintain the `readme.md` file for the Learn-AI curriculum project. These prompts cover all major sections, navigation, content updates, and best practices for documentation.

---

1. **Create a curriculum README for an AI/LLM learning project. Include sections for foundational papers, key methods, surveys, tools, applications, ethics, mathematics, Python, capstone projects, glossary, and further reading.**

2. **Add a navigation menu at the top with internal links to each major section.**

3. **For each section, list key resources (papers, videos, datasets, etc.) with a short description and both local and external links where available.**

4. **For each part (papers, videos, ethics, mathematics, Python, tools, applications, capstone), add a 'Recommended Reading Order' or 'Viewing Order' subsection that suggests a learning sequence.**

5. **Ensure all external links are valid and remove or update any broken links.**

6. **Use relative links for all local files and PDFs.**

7. **Add a Glossary section with definitions for all key terms, models, and methods referenced in the document or linked resources.**

8. **Keep the document up to date with new foundational papers, methods, and surveys as the field evolves.**

9. **Organize capstone projects and challenges with links to datasets and walkthroughs.**

10. **Add further reading and news resources at the end for ongoing learning.**

11. **Maintain consistent formatting, section headers, and bullet styles throughout the document.**

12. **Periodically review and update the recommended reading/viewing orders to reflect the latest best practices and resource quality.**
